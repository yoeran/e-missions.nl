  E-missions investigates a currently overlooked topic in our increasing
  internet-driven society: the ecological footprint of digital behaviour


  Just as many people are unaware that unsafe internet use carries serious risks, most people are also unaware that due to the exponentially increasing fact of being connected and our daily use of streaming, video calling, social media, blockchain and even email our digital footprint is growing drastically.


  A major reason why this is overlooked is the lack of a tangible relationship between digital behaviour and the related consequences.


  An email only becomes tangible when you print it and a streamed series is less tangible than a DVD box on the shelves. In fact, there ‘seems’ to be no raw materials used at all. Unfortunately, this thought is incorrect, because the increase in energy demand as a result of our digital behaviour is one of the fastest growing energy consuming sectors in the world and will only grow faster for the foreseeable future.


  To experience your digital footprint, visit or book a Sensing Co2 tasting experience. To take action on your digital footprint or get inspired to realise digital innovations, visit the topics. To explore more insights, visit our resources section.

  ## Background of the project


  On this web platform, we highlight a small portion of a bigger ecosystem of impacts on the digital footprint. Once calculating, you should track the whole energy chain, and also factors as the age, use and manufacturing of your devices are of importance. This area is work in progress and new data and insights are gained on a continuous basis. This platform gives you the status of 2021.


  E-missions is a digital platform to get insights and take action on your own ecological digital footprint. The goal here is to empower as many people as possible to adopt a sustainable internet mindset and empower them in their own internet use. What if a 'carbon tax' would be introduced for households- how will that influence the users digital behaviour? What if the eco-costs of digitisation will be taken into account for corporate carbon calculators? This project works on a method to taste and see the CO2 emissions as a result of digital behaviour. It plays with awareness and understanding of CO2 and how it should be part of our digital literacy. Let’s work together towards an eco-friendly digital lifestyle.
