body_intro_text: What is (almost) never on the sustainability bucket list of
  measures is lowering the environmental impact of digital behaviour. Until now.
  With the Digital Etiquette tool developed by E-missions, any organisation,
  team, or group of collaborators is able to discuss, define and deploy a code
  of conduct to greenify the digital workstyle of your organisation,
  contributing to the sustainability strategy by making it actionable.

  Digital etiquette is the electronic standard of conduct. It is often also
  referred to at Netiquette and usually deals with a set of online behavioural
  rules users of digital devices should adhere to, very much like social
  etiquettes in daily life. E-missions proposes an addition to the set of
  Digital Etiquette rules in the form of etiquettes from the perspective of
  sustainability. 


  With the Digital Etiquette tool from E-missions professional digital lifestyles can be measured and strategies for sustainability measures and mitigation can be developed. The focus is on 4 themes: cloud storage, e-mail, social media and video conferencing. Each theme has a number of concrete actions to make the ambitions smart. This way, it can become a part of sustainability reporting.


  The tool is open and free to use for anyone, but we are more than willing to help where we can. If you would like to have a Digital Etiquette session at your organisation or want to discuss how you can improve your digital footprint, please contact: rodolfo \[@] in4art.eu
