  With Sensing CO2, we convert CO2 emissions into a sensory taste experience.
  CO2 is an odourless gas and invisible to the human eye. In some exceptions the
  gas is visible: for example as bubbles in sparkling mineral water or sodas.
  Sensing CO2 uses the sensation of a fizzy drink: The added CO2 bubbles trigger
  the tongue receptors while the amount defines the intensity. A minimal
  increase can quickly change pleasure to discomfort. To become resilient, an
  understanding of the matter is crucial. Sensing CO2 aims to connect abstract
  numbers with direct experience, scientific data with human senses. Let your
  taste buds experience how our behaviour influences CO2 levels and taste
  possible futures.


  Based on your personal digital behaviour, the performative installation will enable you to experience different soft drinks, making you taste the different modes of digital, connected communication.
