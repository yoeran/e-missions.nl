  This platform has been created as a space where individuals and organizations
  can go to learn about the topic 'environmental impacts of digital behaviour',
  calculate their own impacts and find ways to become more sustainable online.
  This platform is not, nor does it claim to be, complete in any kind of way.


  Our calculators are based on verifiable sources of knowledge but are not complete nor are they exact representations of reality. All data found on this platform is subject to estimations and/or averages and does not represent individual cases or situations.


  The sources of the data and information used for the separate topic section, can be found in the resource section.  We do not store your calculator results, but you can always return to the take action page to see your battleplan, as long as you use the same device.
