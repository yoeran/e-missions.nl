description: Berries are fragile delicacies with an incredibly short shelf-life.
  This makes them one of the most wasted fruits. Yet their packaging and
  transport is a highly consuming affair. If e-mails were fruits, large
  attachments would be berries. Sending high-resolution photos and extensive
  .pdf files is the most consuming e-mail variant. Such files are better stored
  on a (local) server with a shareable direct link.
