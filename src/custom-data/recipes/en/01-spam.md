description: "If there’s one plant similar to SPAM e-mail, it must be the
  Japanese Knotweed. This very vigorous perennial plant is a very persistent
  weed. It’s tough stems grow through concrete and can cause damage to
  buildings, pipes and roads. On top of that, it is so persistent that once it
  has rooted, it is incredibly difficult to get rid of. So much so, that there
  are Knotweed control companies who basically act as SPAM filter. What to do
  about it yourself? Be scarce with sharing your e-mail adress and adjust your
  SPAM filter every season. As for the Knotweed: try to weaken the plant by
  cutting the stems several times per growing cycle. The shoots should be
  discarded (…not in the compost where they will grow). But why waste Knotweed
  when the plant is edible? With a taste similar to rhubarb, sour, tart and
  tangy, Japanese Knotweed is the ideal ingredient for this refreshing
  lemonade."
