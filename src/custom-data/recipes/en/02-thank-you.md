  "Are deformed carrots edible?" is an actual question on the internet. Yes! They taste just like their straight companions! Please don't discriminate based on appearance. Also: Think twice about sending that e-mail simply containing "Thank you!" or "thanks!!" or perhaps "thx". The exceptionally shaped carrot is our mascotte for being overly perfect and polite. If every Dutch person sent one less thank you e-mail per day, it would save 5.073 tonnes of carbon a year - equivalent to 25.052 flights to Madrid. Letâ€™s save the world with imperfection!

  The Top 10 list of most regularly sent e-mails contains other one-word-mails to perhaps skip every once in a while:

  1. Thank you
  2. Thanks
  3. Have a good weekend
  4. Received
  5. Appreciated
  6. Have a good evening
  7. Did you get/see this?
  8. Cheers
  9. You too
  10. LOL
