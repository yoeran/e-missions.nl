ingredients: Apples or Yellow Lime
emissions: 4 g / e-mail
description: "Lime is a fragrant and delicious fruit, shiny and green. Three for
  a euro? Often it happens that only one is eaten while the others stay
  untouched and dry up and turn yellow. Their fate is similar to many cc:
  e-mail's, received, unread and slowly loosing relevance. On the contrary,
  yellow limes are still full of flavour and have been used to make this zesty
  lemonade."
