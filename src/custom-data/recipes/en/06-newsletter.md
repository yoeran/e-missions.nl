  Whether fallen apples are small, green and unripe, or matured and ready to harvest: they are the result of a trees' natural size reduction. This moment is called "June drop". An inbox can sometimes look quite similar to the ground underneath a tree: scattered with newsletters that stay unread until the next season or are deleted without being read. Receiving mail from senders that you haven't signed up for? There should always be an "unsubscribe" link at the end of an e-mail. Pour yourself a glass of lemonade, unsuscribe from all those unread newsletters and save up to 60kg of CO2 emissions in a year (which is equal to producing 1kg of beef)!
