  In 2020 Russian president Vladimir Putin extended the embargo on European food until 2022. Dutch and Belgian pear farmers suffer particularly and experience volatile sales. Take a look at your inbox and count the confirmation e-mails. Why not put an embargo on those too! When ordering just one item online, you can receive up to 8 e-mails: confirmation of your account, confirmation of your order, confirmation that the package is sent out, confirmation that the package arrived at the distribution centerâ€¦ and so forth. One confirmation is enough! Time for an automated email boycott!
