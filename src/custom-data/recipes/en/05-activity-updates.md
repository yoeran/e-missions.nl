ingredients: Lemon balm
emissions: 5 g / e-mail
description: "This herb can rapidly sprout, yet be easily structured: Lemon balm
  grows in clumps and spreads by seeds and vegetatively (a new seedling
  germinates from a fragment of the parent plant). Once you start growing it,
  there's almost always too much, just like those activity updates in your
  inbox. Activity updates are e-mails sent by social platforms such as Facebook,
  Slack or Teams. It is a practical feature to not miss important messages. But
  does it also happen to you, that your entire inbox is overwhelmed with
  updates? These e-mails of notifications of updates of activities are like the
  overly energetic lemon balm, adjust to taste."
