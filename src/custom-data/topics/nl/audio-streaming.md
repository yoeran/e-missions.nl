body_intro_text: "The modern environmental cost of music can be divided into
  four eras’: the Vinyl era in the seventies, the Cassette era in the eighties,
  the CD era in the nineties, and the online music era in which we find
  ourselves today. Although the amount of time per day we listen to audio has
  not really changed, the impacts on the planet have. Massively."

  ## Did you know Audio Streaming accounts for X emissions of the world?

  Did you know that the most played music clips on YouTube have emitted more CO2 just by having been streamed so much than entire nations over the course of a year? In 2021, the first ever music clip reached 9 billion views. Baby Shark Dance is therefor single handedly responsible for CO2 emissions higher than the total annual emissions of countries such as Estonia, Croatia or Slovakia.


  We spend on average per day 1 hour and 31 minutes listening to music streams. The environmental cost of music is now greater than at any time during recorded music’s previous eras2


  When we listen to music, we may ask ourselves: Under what conditions was a particular recording made? How equitable is the process by which it has reached us? Who is being paid? How are they being treated? And—most pressing—how much music do we really need? Perhaps, if we have less of it, it may matter to us more.3


  Streaming may reduce the upfront production of carbon, but it makes increased energy demands and emissions every time a song is played.


  If we would stop listening to music and podcasts online when we travel, we could save enormous amounts of CO2 emissions as a result. Some 500.000 tons per year, for which we would need around 2 million trees to capture.


  To make a living as a musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking hour


  Environmental costs of audio can be divided into plastics used and CO2 emissions emitted. In terms of plastics, the transition to streaming and downloading around and after 2013 was a good thing – coming from 61 million kg in the CD era to 8 million kg.


  In terms of CO2 emissions, the trend is the opposite, having risen from 157 million kg in the CD era to over 350 million kg in the streaming age in 2016 already and rising fast.4


  Streaming music is bad news for water as our 1.5 hour daily average equals 5 bathtubs of water requirement to power and cool the infrastructure required each month.5
