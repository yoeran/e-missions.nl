body_intro_text: Blockchains are a new phenomenon. What started with the
  introduction of the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin has already evolved into a
  new way to store and share digital information. Although not yet widely used,
  blockchains are popping up everywhere and use cases are being designed and
  developed around the globe. Most blockchains run on a distributed
  authentication process which involves many computers who all need to run a
  compute intensive algorithm to verify and approve each new transaction on the
  blockchain. This could be a document, a picture, a token or something else.
  This is called the Proof of Work principle (PoW) and requires enormous amounts
  of electricity for each single transaction.
tips:
  - tip: Do not use blockchain technology, yet
    explanation: For the moment there is no way you could use blockchain technology
      in an environmentally friendly manner. However, progress is being made in
      introducing a new verification method based on random selection called
      Proof-of-Stake. This would cut the environmental impact of the blockchain
      enormously.
    todo: o	Wait for the introduction of the Proof-of-Stake verification method
      before developing blockchain based applications

  **Did you know the blockchain industry alone could produce enough CO2 to
  result in a 2 degrees global warming?**


  The numbers are really astounding and quite frightening as well. If blockchain remains based on the Proof-of-Work principle it could end up causing enough CO2 emissions to be solely responsible for rising temperatures. Already now, a single Non-Fungible Token (NFT) release consumes more electricity in 10 seconds than a house in a year. And the two biggest blockchains on the net, Bitcoin and Ethereum, together consume more energy per year than Spain or Mexico.  


  Blockchain is a promising technology with many possibilities for peer-to-peer direct transactions, but as long as we havenâ€™t found ways to slash the electricity needs the best and only ecologically responsible strategy is to wait with getting on the block.
