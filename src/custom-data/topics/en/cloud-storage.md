title: Cloud Storage

body_intro_text: The cloud has obesities. Approximately 90% of all the data we
  store will never be used. Unstructured data sets will never be analyzed, IoT
  sensor data will never be read. Video’s, software, movies, photo’s, music,
  documents. We only use around 10% of everything we collect and store in the
  cloud. Privately, as well as professionally.
calculator_text: For every 100 GB of data stored on a cloud we emit close to
  10kg of CO2 each year, for which we need 2 new trees planted to take this out
  of the atmosphere. Almost everybody uses some type of cloud storage, privately
  if you own a smartphone. But also work related. Over 90% of companies are on
  the cloud. That is why it is interesting to see the impact you have yourself
  but also the impact of your company on the planet through the simple act of
  storing data on a cloud based server.
tips:
  - tip: Take long term storage data offline
    explanation: Most of the data stored online can be labeled as ‘don’t need it
      now, might need it later’. By rethinking what we store and archive in
      terms of short and long term needs, you can start categorizing your
      datasets in 1) to be used in the short term and 2) to be used long term.
      With taking the long term data offline, you can reach enormous savings.
    todo: Identify long term data sets, take them off the cloud and store them
      offline
  - tip: Store your data with a green cloud provider
    explanation: "Carbon-thoughtful providers have sustainability at the heart of
      how they plan, build, power, operate, and retire their data centers. Some
      green cloud providers are: Evry, GreenQloud, Google, Cloudsigma, Dediserve
      and WindCloud."
    todo: "Choose a green and sustainable cloud provider to store your data "
  - tip: Avoid the double data
    explanation: A lot of data on clouds worldwide is stored multiple times.
      Identifying and taking out doubles can already to wonders to the amount of
      cloud space you use.
    todo: Check my stored data on doubles and delete double saved data
  - tip: Optimize applications for cloud storage
    explanation: "Companies can realize large carbon emission reductions on their
      cloud storage effects by configuring applications, documents, datasets and
      websites for the cloud. Most importantly: make it slim through
      compression, file type selection, website design and application design."
    todo: Optimize applications for cloud storage (for companies mainly)

  **Did you know the amount of datacenters across the globe has exploded in the
  last 10 years?**


  In 2012 there were around 500.000 data centers around the world, today this amount is over 8 million, and in the coming years there will be many more. The already obese cloud is getting fatter and fatter. Energy needs double every 4 years, making cloud storage the fastest growing energy consuming sector there is. If we go on like this, by 2040, an estimated 14% of the world’s CO2 emissions will be caused by the electricity demand of data centers.


  Fortunately there is a lot we can do about this. With 90% of all data never used, with much data stored for long term collection purposed, with many double entries and with suboptimized application configurations there are many areas in which we can become more efficient in using cloud storage spaces.


  The size of the cloud might seem endless, but the effects on earth are very real. It is time to do some cleaning up on our private and corporate clouds.
