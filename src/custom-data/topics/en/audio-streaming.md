body_intro_text: "The modern environmental cost of music can be divided into
  four eras’: the Vinyl era in the seventies, the Cassette era in the eighties,
  the CD era in the nineties, and the online music era in which we find
  ourselves today. Although the amount of time per day we listen to audio has
  not really changed, the impacts on the planet have. Massively."

  **Did you know the environmental cost of music is now greater than at any time
  during recorded music’s history?**


  The environmental costs of audio can be divided into plastics used and CO2 emissions emitted. In terms of plastics, the transition to streaming and downloading around and after 2013 was a good thing compared to the era’s of vinyl and CDs. Actually, the total amount of plastics used to produce music carriers came down from 61 million kg per year in 2013 to 8 million kg per year last year.


  However, in terms of CO2 emissions, the trend is the opposite, and stronger, as the CO2 emission impact per year having risen from 157 million kg in the CD era to nearing 500 million kg in the streaming age today and still rising fast. 


  To realize just how much this is, let’s look at an example. In 2021, the music clip Baby Shark Dance reached 9 billion streams, being the first single song to be streamed over 9 billion times. This does not only make it a very popular song, it also means that just this song alone is single handedly responsible for emitting more CO2 than the annual emissions of an entire country such as Croatia or Slovakia.


  Globally, we spend on average per day 1 hour and 31 minutes listening to music streams.
