  **Did you know we would need 3.5 times as many tree filled football fields in
  the Netherlands as we currently have each year to offset the emissions from
  online gaming?**


  Online gaming is a fast growing environmental problem. In the Netherlands, over 4 million hours are spend each day playing games online. To compensate for this act of pleasure, we need to plant 17 million new trees each year. Since online gaming is seen as a form of sports, let’s compare this to the most popular sport in the Netherlands: football. To plant these 17 million trees each year, we need an area the size of 24.000 football pitches. We currently have around 7.000 pitches in the country. This means we should fill the complete stock of Dutch football pitches with trees every quarter of the year to compensate for the carbon emissions emitted through online gaming in the Netherlands.
