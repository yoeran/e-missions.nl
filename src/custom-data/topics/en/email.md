  daily life. In fact, while you were reading this sentence, over 10 million
  emails were send. It has become one of the most important technologies we use
  to communicate. With colleagues, clients or partners. But also with family,

  send over 300 billion mails every day. How does your email behavior impact the
  planet? And what about the organization you work for?

  Did you know that, on average, 47% of all emails we receive is spam? And that 24% contain attachments? Off course, this differs per person, just as the amount of emails you send and receive per day. To built this calculator we have used knowledge on types of emails, sizes of emails, reading times, device the mail is read on, amount of emails opened, amounts stored versus deleted. They all influence the electricity consumed with email behavior. But nothing matters as much as the amount of emails one sends on an average day and the % of those mails that contain attachments. And if you think your impact is acceptable, see what the organization you work in emits as a whole.
tips:
  - tip: Unsubscribe from newsletters
    explanation: Only 2 out of 10 newsletters get opened and an average internet
      user receives over 4.000 newsletters per year. Unsubscribing from
      newsletters is one of the quickest ways to lower your email impact. You
      can manually unsubscribe by scrolling to the bottom of an email and click
      on the link “Unsubscribe” or “Change email preferences.” To facilitate
      this process, third party tools are available, like Unroll.me, Cleanfox or
      Mailstorm.
    todo: Seek the 8 out of 10 newsletters you receive but don’t read and
      unsubscribe from them
  - tip: Delete newsletters
    explanation: How long does the information in a newsletter stays relevant? Most
      newsletters are stored unnecessarily. In the Netherlands alone, unopened,
      stored newsletters emit more than 1 million tons of CO2 per year. This is
      equivalent to driving 1.3 million cars.
    todo: Delete the newsletters saved in your mailbox unnecessarily
  - tip: Only send emails to who needs to receive them
    explanation: Limiting ‘reply all’ and being strict on putting people in CC can
      do a lot for your impact. Around 75% of the mails you receive in CC/reply
      all is considered irrelevant and unnecessary by the receiver.
    todo: Define a strategy for emailing and focus on limiting the use of reply all
      and CC.

    explanation: On average 24% of our mails contain attachments. They are the real
      influencers of email impact. Off course, sending attachments is an
      efficient and easy way to share documents, images or presentations. But
      there are a few things you might want to do to be a smarter sender and
      receiver of attachments.
    todo: Minimize the size of your attachments by sending image compressed PDFs or
      ZIP files

  .Did you know reading your email on your mobile is a lot greener than reading
  your email on a desktop?


  Just over half of all emails (54%) get read on a desktop, 46% get read on a mobile device. This can be a laptop, a tablet or a phone. In fact, using your phone to read email is, by far, the greenest way because it uses a lot less electricity to complete the task.


  How important emailing has become in our daily lives has been researched frequently. Those of us with an office job spend on average over 2.5 hours each day checking, reading, writing emails. Having a good strategy for emailing not only leads to less impact on the planet but also has many health benefits.


  For several years there has been one day in the year on which a lot of more emails were send than on any other day. We know this day as Black Friday.
