body_intro_text: Smart – phones, cars, thermostats, doorbells, locks, fridges,
  tablets, watches, bands, assistants, lights, key chains, curtains…if you can
  think it, somebody is probably working on making it ‘smart’. The promise of
  devices connected to the internet at home, the office and even outside is that
  it will make our lives more comfortable, safe and enjoyable. While that might
  be true, the other side of the coin is the impact this tsunami of smart
  devices is having on our planet.
calculator_text: In the smart devices category, the most impactful is the fast
  rate of growth in the amount of smart devices we bring into our homes and
  offices. The calculator shows how many trees you need to plant each year to
  offset your current smart device collection. It also projects the amount of
  trees you will need annually 3 years from now based on your rate of growth.
tips:
  - tip: Prioritize smart devices that reduce energy consumption
    explanation: Some devices have a net positive effect because they save more
      energy (through efficiency) than they consume. Think about smart lights
      which are only on when needed for instance.
    todo: Identify which smart devices save energy and which do not in your
      home/office and decide for the latter category if you really need them.
  - tip: Dim the brightness of your screens
    explanation: Dimming the brightness of your screens from 100% to 70% can save up
      to 20% of the used energy plus it reduces eye strain.
    todo: Adjust the standard brightness of all my screens to 70%
  - tip: Shut down and kill the vampire power
    explanation: Devices which are directly connected to the grid through a cable or
      a plug keep drawing energy while they are not needed.
    todo: Shut down devices if you will be away for more than 2 hours (except for
      security devices)
  - tip: Shut down to kill the vampire power
    explanation: Devices which are directly connected to the grid through a cable or
      a plug keep drawing energy while they are not needed.

  **Do you know how many Amazons we need to plant to offset the electricity use
  of all smart devices in the world?**


  To offset the 50 billion smart devices we will be using globally by 2030 we need to plant an additional 25 Amazon rainforests to offset their annual electricity usage alone. Because that is, off course, impossible, we need to become smarter in how we make, use, and dispose of our smart devices. For if we don’t, our super smart homes, offices and cities will turn out to be not so smart at all when it comes to fighting climate change.


  In the production chain, factors like who makes it, where is it made, and is it designed for recycling have to become basic questions before we buy a new smart device. In using the devices, minimizing the standby losses and prioritizing ecologically smart devices make a lot of sense. When disposing, producers who offer circular recycling are the best options.
