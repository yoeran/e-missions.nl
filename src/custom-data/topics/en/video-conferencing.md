body_intro_text: "In what seems to be a distant past, video conferencing was
  something done by executives and directors to avoid continuous travelling
  across the globe. But since the Corona virus outbreak and subsequent global
  pandemic, video conferencing has become the standard for communicating between
  colleagues, teams and with clients, partners. Even with family members and
  friends living abroad and during lockdowns. This has a lot of benefits: less
  travelling, less organizing, less time needed to meet. But a flipside of the
  coin is the environmental impact of this transition."
calculator_text: Video conferences consume energy on the local computer, in the
  transmission network and in the data centre. Anyone sitting in front of a
  computer permanently connected to the internet consumes 6 Wh more energy per
  hour during video conferences. If the video conference is transmitted via
  mobile network, the additional consumption is 24 Wh per hour. This means you
  can video conference your heart out and still have a limited impact on the
  environment. However, video conferencing never comes alone, and when we take
  into account the amount of people around you conferencing with the same
  frequency, the numbers start to add up.
tips:
  - tip: Turn of your camera when someone is presenting
    explanation: Video accounts for 80% of the total data traffic when video
      conferencing. In many settings, turning off your video is considered rude
      or is a sign of being uninterested. Agreeing upon a new etiquette for
      video conferencing based on turning video on when conversing but off when
      listening to a presentation is needed.
    todo: Adopt a new etiquette for video conferencing within your organization/group
  - tip: Lower video streaming quality
    explanation: Streaming on medium quality cuts data use by 40% and you probably
      won’t even notice the difference. You can lower streaming quality in your
      streaming settings. By using vectors (line based representation of an
      image) instead of video stream, you can lower the bandwidth even further,
      with 95%.
    todo: "Lower streaming quality in your streaming settings (and make use of
      vectors: line based representation of an image)"
  - explanation: When video conferencing, using mobile internet bundles (4G/5G) is
      the worst option there is. Whatever carrier you use, making sure you are
      connected to a fixed or WiFi connection which uses a lot less energy.
    tip: Always use a fixed internet connection or WiFi and never mobile traffic
    todo: Make sure you are connected to WiFi when entering a video conferencing call

  **How big should your organizations tree park be to keep pace of video
  conferencing?**


  Most companies have a strategic plan to lower the environmental impact of their car park, but does your organization have a strategy to build a tree park as well? When you have adopted a ‘minimize video on’ conferencing etiquette, lowered the resolution and made sure everybody has access to a fixed internet connection or good WIFI when entering professional calls, the final step to become conference call neutral in terms of environmental impact could be to start building a tree park.
