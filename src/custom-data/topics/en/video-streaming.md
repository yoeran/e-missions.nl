  In 2021, Netflix was the big winner at the Emmy awards. We all have at least
  one streaming subscription. Every minute, worldwide, we watch over 750.000
  hours of Netflix. What effects does the enormous scale and speed of our move
  from cable television and DVDs to video streaming have on the environment?

  Every hour streamed uses on average 2.3 kWh of energy per year. With this
  basis, and information on the emissions per kWh, we calculate the CO2 impact
  of every hour watched in the Netherlands but also across Europe and Worldwide.
  The impact calculator does not show the CO2 impact of your individual
  behaviour, since we are talking about a massive trend here. Instead, you see
  what the overall impact is should every subscriber of Netflix video streaming
  adopt the same behaviour as you do.


  The calculator shows how many cities of Amsterdam we need to plant with trees each year to compensate for our streaming behaviour.
tips:
  - tip: Lower video streaming quality
    explanation: Streaming on medium quality cuts data use by 40% and you probably
      won’t even notice the difference.
    todo: Lower streaming quality in your streaming settings
  - tip: Always use a fixed internet connection or WiFi and never mobile traffic
    explanation: When video streaming, using mobile internet bundles is the worst
      option there is. Whatever carrier you use, making sure you are connected
      to a fixed or WiFi connection which uses a lot less energy.

  - tip: Go offline
    explanation: Download your episodes or films onto your laptop or tablet and play
      from there when travelling.

      before travelling

  **Did you know DVDs are less polluting than HD streaming?**


  Watching a HD stream of a film could emit as much CO2 as manufacturing, transporting and playing a DVD. A DVD can be stored, rewatched, lend out, whereas a film on a streaming service produces the same impact each time it is watched. Instead of watching 1 DVD, we watch series for multiple hours per day. What can we learn from the DVD era when using video streams? Off course, when we think we might rewatch a film, episode or documentary, the best thing to do is download it and avoid re-streaming. And although we cannot lend out a downloaded film on Netflix, we can invite those whom we want to see the film over and watch the downloaded version together. It would even be more fun. Stream responsibly, stream once.
