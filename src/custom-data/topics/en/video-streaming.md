  In 2021, Netflix was the big winner at the Emmy awards. We all have at least
  one streaming subscription. Every minute, worldwide, we watch over 750.000
  hours of Netflix. What effects does the enormous scale and speed of our move
  from cable television and DVDs to video streaming have on the environment?
tips:
  - tip: Lower video streaming quality
    explanation: Streaming on medium quality cuts data use by 40% and you probably
      won’t even notice the difference.
    todo: Lower streaming quality in your streaming settings
  - tip: Always use a WLAN or WIFI and never mobile traffic
    explanation: When video streaming, using mobile internet bundles is the worst
      option there is. Whatever carrier you use, making sure you are connected
      to a WIFI or WLAN which uses a lot less energy.
    todo: Make sure you are connected to WLAN or WIFI when streaming a video
  - tip: Go offline
    explanation: Download your episodes or films onto your laptop or tablet and play
      from there when travelling.

      before travelling

  **Did you know DVDs are less polluting than HD streaming?**


  Watching a HD stream of a film emits as much CO2 as manufacturing, transporting and playing a DVD. A DVD can be stored, rewatched, lend out, whereas a film on a streaming service produces the same impact each time it is watched. What can we learn from the DVD era when using video streams? Off course, when we think we might rewatch a film, episode or documentary, the best thing to do is download it and avoid re-streaming. And although we cannot lend out a downloaded film on Netflix, we can invite those whom we want to see the film over and watch the downloaded version together. It would even be more fun. Stream responsibly, stream once.
