body_intro_text: Almost 4.5 billion people on the planet use social media on a
  daily basis. Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIN, Instagram, SnapChat, Twitter and
  their Chinese equivalents belong to the most used social media platforms in
  the world and are known to all. The CO2 impact of being active on these
  platforms comes from the amount of followers you have. This means that the
  same post can have a very different impact depending on if you share it with
  100 followers or 10.000. Should the ecological impact of a post be a
  consideration to take into account before hitting the post button?
calculator_text: This calculator differentiates between posts that contain only
  text, images and minutes of video. This because the electricity consumed
  differs between the three categories. After clicking the ‘post’ button, your
  post gets published on the platform and reloaded each time a follower sees it.
  This makes the impact of a post to 500 followers instead of 50 followers - 10
  times higher. With many accounts aiming for a high amount of followers, the
  impact becomes serious quite fast.
tips:
  - tip: Disable automatic video play
    explanation: By default, all the video’s embedded in your social media feeds
      will start playing automatically when scrolling past them. The extra
      energy used compared to just seeing the image of the post can be up to 10x
      as much.
    todo: Go to the settings section of your social media accounts and disable
      automatic video play or enable data saving mode.
  - tip: Use a time blocker
    explanation: Social media can be addictive. Software, like an app or browser
      extension, can help you reduce the amount of time you spend using social
      media. Think of apps like Moment, AppBlock, OffScreen and many others.
    todo: Install a social media blocker
  - tip: Slow down on the clips and images
    explanation: One image containing post consumes the same amount of energy as a
      thousand text only posts. Although an image can tell a thousand words
      (literally in this case), ask yourself what the added value of each image
      actually is.
    todo: Focus on using words to share your message and only use images or clips
      when they have a real added value
  - tip: Reduce the file size of the video
    todo: Change video recording settings to standard or low resolution
    explanation: Social media videos are often made in high resolution, resulting in
      large file sizes. However, they function perfectly well at a fraction of
      the size by reducing the resolution. You can realize energy savings by
      adjusting video quality settings in favour of decreasing resolution. This
      counts both for uploading and streaming the social media video post. You
      can exercise choice in your video streaming habits by turning to standard
      or low resolution, instead of having high resolution by default.

  **Do you nurture a social media garden, park or forest?**


  Who posts a lot, gains followers. Who has a lot of followers, needs to post a lot. That is, in a nutshell, how the algorithmic strategy of social media platforms work. The goal is to have as many people as possible on the platform, for as long as possible. And they are succeeding quite well. Each day we spend almost 2.5 hours on social media. If we continue in the same pace; posting, scrolling, liking and commenting takes up almost 6 years of our life between the age of 16 and 70.


  If you just post once per day, with an image and every now and then a short video clip to your 100 friends and family members following you, you will need to plant 1 tree a year in your garden to compensate for this behavior. If you do the same but with 10.000 followers, it becomes a small park with 141 new trees each year. And if you have the same habit with 350.000 followers on your account, you will need to double the amount of trees in the Vondelpark, 5.000 trees,  each year to offset your personal impact. You can imagine which social media influencers need to fill forests with their activities.
